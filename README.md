# Income vs Rent - Linear Regression ML Project

This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict Rent based on Income.

## Dataset
A simple CSV dataset with columns:
- Income: Monthly income of an individual
- Rent: Corresponding rent amount

## ML Techniques Used
- Linear Regression (from scikit-learn)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Model evaluation (R² Score, Mean Squared Error)

## Files Included
- Income-vs-RENT-ML.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with full EDA + ML code

## Goal
To predict rent based on a person’s income using machine learning.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Regression Modeling
- Visualizations
- Real-world ML use case

## How to Run
1. Open `Income-vs-Rent-ML.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Colab
2. Run all cells to see full prediction pipeline
